# Spectrum Analyzer
FFT Spectrum Analyzer
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a powerful tool for analyzing and measuring signals. For
instance, we are able to effectively acquire time-domain signals, measure the frequency content,
and convert the results to real-world units and displays as seen on a traditional benchtop
spectrum analyzer. Analysing the frequency spectrum of a signal gives us an idea about the
frequency components of a signal, its power, bandwidth and other specifications of the signal
that cannot be detected in the time domain.
